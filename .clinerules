# Project Rules & Patterns

## Code Organization
1. Components grouped by feature in src/components/
2. Custom hooks for state management in src/hooks/
3. Types defined in src/types/index.ts

## Component Patterns
1. Feature-based directory structure
2. Separate container and presentational components
3. Props interfaces defined at component level

## State Management
1. Custom hooks for domain-specific state
2. Component-level state for UI interactions
3. Props for component communication

## TypeScript Usage
1. Strict type checking enabled
2. Interfaces for component props
3. Type definitions in dedicated files

## Development Workflow
1. Feature development in isolated components
2. Custom hooks for reusable logic
3. TypeScript for type safety
