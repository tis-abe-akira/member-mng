# Active Context

## Current Focus
Building core functionality for member management and chat system

## Recent Changes
1. Storage adapter pattern implementation
2. LocalStorage integration for all data
3. Member data persistence with async operations
4. Chat system persistence and sync with members
5. Loading states and error handling
6. Automatic view transitions for better UX

## Active Development
### In Progress
- Real-time updates for chat system
- Tag management system persistence
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Error recovery mechanisms

### Next Steps
1. Complete member CRUD operations
2. Implement chat message handling
3. Finalize tag management system

## Current Decisions
1. Using custom hooks with async operations
2. Component-based architecture with loading states
3. Storage adapter pattern for unified data persistence
4. LocalStorage as initial storage implementation
5. Immediate sync between members and chats
6. Automatic view transitions for better UX

## Active Considerations
1. Future storage implementations (Firebase, REST API)
2. Data migration strategies
3. Real-time update mechanisms
4. Performance optimization patterns
5. Error recovery and retry mechanisms
